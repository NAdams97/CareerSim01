# CareerSim01
Block09 Career Simulation, Personal Website Pt1
The home page contains an image as well as a slogan and short descriptive text.
It also displays a js driven alert that has been deferred.
The about page contains three images related to interests of mine as well as brief descriptors of the relevance of each image.
The portfolio page does not have any coding related project to be displayed and so it has a short text explaining this as well as a placeholder image of the pokemon Amoonguss stanced up.
A nav bar has been applied to each page by copy and pasting the code for it into the same place on each html file and using the same CSS classes to style it across all sheets.
The background for each page has been set to antique white.
The website has used horizontal rules to keep each subject visually organized as well as to separate the nav bar from the remainder of the site.
